Hello,

My name is Norah Vii and this is my personal philosophy blog.  

Philosophical essays shared here are for visibility and feedback. You'll find them to be highly interdisciplinary, exploring themes ranging from cosmological theories and systems problems to late 19th and early 20th-century, or even ancient, philosophy.  

GitHub is my platform of choice due to the control it gives me and potential for collaboration with other likeminded people. It's possible for others to fork and push changes here, which makes perfecting written works over time easier than traditional academic journals. It also allows me to use Markdown, which supports LaTeX and is easier for people and computers to read than PDF.  

I have been programming since the COVID-19 pandemic, and have since worked at Washington University in St. Louis in a research lab studying Alzheimer's Disease. During my time there I provided coding mentorship to students, developed neuroimaging pipelines, various scripts using primarily Python and a clinical participant tracking database. I introduced a novel hormone regime scale to make studying sex differences easier, but experienced some intellectual containment leading to my departure.  

Amidst a challenging job market for the IT industry in 2025, I've actively provided tech support and freelance automation services. My current goals are to continue to enhance my programming and mathematical capabilities and explore their applications to areas like the humanities and theoretical physics.  

Thanks for stopping by,
Norah Vii (she/her/they)
